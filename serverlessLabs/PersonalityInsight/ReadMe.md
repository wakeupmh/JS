  Watson is an **IBM** [supercomputer](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/supercomputer) that combines artificial intelligence ([AI](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence)) and sophisticated analytical software for optimal performance as a "question answering" machine computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language based on  **cognitive computing** ðŸ¤¯

**Cognitive computing**  is a technique which is a set of several techniques:

-   **Machine learning**  is a technique where system tries to get better day by day by learning new things, just like we humans do.
-   **Natural language processing**  is a way of interaction with computers by means of a language that we speak daily (i.e. English).
-   **Artificial intelligence**  is the way by which computers perform some tasks which actually need human intelligence.
-   **Human interaction**  is the way in which computers can interact with humans, yes you can say natural language processing as a subset of human interaction.
